# Wiser Riser

üß™ An open-source web3-based social media component set for scaling up moderator effort on sites with a lot of user-generated content.
This could be used in social media settings (similar to Reddit), in screening processes for quadratic funding community support rounds
(like a blend of Giveth and Gitcoin), and co-learning/review communities (e.g. around photography, writing, or much more).

‚öôÔ∏è This was built using Scaffold-ETH 2 at [ETHGlobal Waterloo 2023](https://ethglobal.com/events/waterloo2023).

## How To Run

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

In this directory, then run `yarn install`.

Then open three terminal windows in this directory.

In one, run `yarn chain` as a test blockchain.
In the second browser window, run `yarn start` and then visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
In the third, run `yarn deploy` to deploy the test contracts.  If you want to deploy to a different network, use `yarn deploy --network target_network`. You may also wish to change the "targetNetwork" value in scaffold.config.ts.
To deploy elsewhere, you may need the environment variables ALCHEMY_API_KEY and DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY set by renaming `.env.example`¬†to¬†`.env`¬†and filling in required keys. `yarn generate`¬†can get you a new random account and add the private key to that .env file.

You can do Etherscan verification with `yarn verify --network network_name` and you can deploy a frontend to vercel without type/lint checking by using `yarn vercel:yolo` & set `NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNORE_BUILD_ERROR` to `true` in a [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).
